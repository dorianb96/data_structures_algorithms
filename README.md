## Data structures and algorithms

#### In this folder you can find a lot of code I wrote when learning data structures and algorithms. I haven't commited the JUnit test with code, but the implementations are mostly correct

#### Some of the contents are:
- Divide And Conquer paradigm
- Dynamic Programming paradigm
- Recursion/Backtracking problems
- Interview type problems
- Sorting problems
- ArrayList
- Graph
- HashTable
- Heap
- LinkedList
- Queue
- Stack
- Trees
- Problem sets from University course (100% correct)
